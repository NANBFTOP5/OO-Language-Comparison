# Unique features of the language

* Does the language have any paticularly unique features?

    * Python

      Simple: Python is a simple and simple language. Reading a good Python program feels like reading English (but very strict English!). Python's pseudo-code nature is one of its greatest strengths. It allows you to focus on the solution to the problem, not the grammar itself. Easy to Learn: As you can see, Python is easy to get started. It can be said that most of the features that Python has can by found in other languages that influenced Python. Embeddable: You can embed Python into a C / C ++ program to provide scripting functionality for the program's users. Portable: Because of its open source nature, Python has been ported to many platforms (i.e., to make it work). 

   * C#

     ### Assemblies

     * This is a level of encapsulation above the typical namespaces or modules in most languages. Assemblies are similar to the idea of static/dynamic libraries in C or JAR files in Java.

     * Notably, you can mark members as internal, which makes them public within the same assembly, but private to everybody outside the assembly. This is quite useful.

     ### Cross-language compatibility is first-class (not just for C)

     * C# runs in the Common Language Runtime, which was designed from the beginning to support interoperability between languages.

     ### Properties are first-class

     * No longer need to write explicit getter and (optional) setter methods.

     ### Listeners are first-class
     * Classes can declare an event Foo with addFooListener and removeFooListener functionality built in.
     * Unfortunately the implementation has some annoyances4.

     ### Foreign Methods5 are first-class
     * C# calls these extension methods.

     ### Partial Classes
     * Allows a classâ€™s members to be defined in multiple files.

     * Useful to add functionality to a generated class (for example, from a parser generator) without those modifications getting lost when the class is next regenerated.
