# Why was the Language created

* Python

   Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming language. Python is a high-level general-purpose programming language that can be applied to many different classes of problems. (From Python) I think python was created to bridge the gap between C and the shell.

* C#
  
  C# was created to be a object- oriented programming language based on C. C# is a multi-paradigm programming language encompassing strong typing, imperative, declarative, functional, generic, object-oriented (class-based), and component-oriented programming disciplines. It was developed by Microsoft within its .NET initiative and later approved as a standard by Ecma (ECMA-334) and ISO (ISO/IEC 23270:2006).

# What problems was the language trying to address

* Python

  I think Python wins in the texts processing compared with other scripting languages, Python is very simpler than others languages. In addition, Google, Yahoo, NASA and other large companies widely used python to achieve a variety of functions. Moreover, Python greatly reduces the number of lines of code written by the program.

* C#

    C# attempted to address portability, memory and processing requirements of C, increase simplicity, and add software engineering principles not included in C.

# Is the language a reaction to a previous language or a replacement for another language

* Python

  Python is a great candidate to substitute C++ in many problem domains. I don't think Python is a replacement for another language or is a reaction to previous language. However, in some way, Python can replace Java. 

* C#

  C# was a reaction to C, it added object- oriented concepts to C.
