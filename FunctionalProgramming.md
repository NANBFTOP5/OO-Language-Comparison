### Functional Programming Support
## Does the Language support functional programming?

## Python

Python has some support for functional programming.

### Support For:

* First class functions
* lambda functions
* functools library which gives functional capabilities

I would not recommend using haskell as a functional language, as the language designers have not explicitly designed the language to be used in such a way.

### Lacks support for:
* Tail Call Optimization

## C#

* First class functions
* Can mark fields and variables as readonly to enforce immutability.

With some difficulty it is possible to use C# in a functional style, but it is not recommended as the language was not designed for this purpose.
